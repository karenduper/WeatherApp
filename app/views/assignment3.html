<b>Assignment 3 </b><br>

<br>
<b>1. Create a NodeJS script that will do the following:</b><br>
Download an Image from S3.<br>
Check if the metadata key “Move” of the image is true.<br>
If true, upload the image to s3://cc116-assignment3/{MATRICULA}/image.png<br>
20 points.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Create a NodeJS script that will do the following:</b><br>
Will get the Nasa Astronomic Picture of the day.<br>
Save the image in the local file system.<br>
Print the title of the image.<br>
20 points.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Implement Google Analytics in your personal web site (All teams will do the same for their Final Project). 20 points.</b><br>
To implement this you need to go and create a Google Analytics account that will give you a property ID. Once you have done this you'll have the code below:
<br>
<div class="codebox">
 <code>
    <!-- Google Analytics -->
    &lt;script&gt;<br>
      (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){<br>
          (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),<br>
        m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)<br>
      })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');<br>
   <br>
    ga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');<br>
    ga('send', 'pageview');<br>
   &lt;/script&gt;<br>
   <!-- End Google Analytics --><br>
  </code>
</div>
<br>
The code should be added before the closing <div class="codebox">
  <code>
    &lt;/head&gt;
  </code>
</div> tag, and the string 'UA-XXXXX-Y' should be replaced with the property ID. <br>


<br>
<b>4. Read and explain the following article by Martin Fowler: http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html. 20 points</b><br>
<br>

It portrays the REST model and its principal elements into three steps seen as levels; those being resources, http verbs and hypermedia controls. And how to make use of them to build integrated systems in an easier way for enterprises using web-style system properties.

There’s a level 0 which represents a starting point for this model which uses HTTP as a transport system but without the concepts belonging to the web. Level 1 basically makes requests to individual resources. In Level 2 it uses HTTP verbs the way you would use them in HTTP, no longer like a tunneling mechanism. And in Level 3 it introduces HATEOAS.
<br>
<br>
<b>5. Explain why cloud computing is important. 10 points.</b><br>
<br>

Because it reduces costs and complexity allowing developers to do big things without investing as much on certain resources, helping democratize high performance computing. It balances the scale between resourceful companies and those without access to those resources.
<br>
<br>
<b>6. Explain what would you like to change in this class and why. 10 points.</b><br>
<br>

I would like the class to be a bit more slow paced, the teacher already speaks too fast so a lot of content in a very fast paced environment becomes difficult to process and to analyze. Also I think that when we are learning about code the process could be more segmented because trying to make code work, understand it and also listen to the teacher all at the same time it’s unmanageable and, for me at least, has never worked.
